## Project: BATTLESHIP

### Group Member Names: Jack Gould and Stella Bonnie

#### Goals and Expectations for the Project

*What does each group member hope to get out of this project?*  

  * Both: More competence in using Github (branches, push, pull, PR)

  * Stella: More confidence/less fear about working with others

  * Jack: collaborate really well and pass with flying colors

*What do we want to achieve as a team?*

  * Complete iteration 3!

*How will we know that we're successful?*

  * If we pass!

#### Team strengths & collaboration styles:

 *(consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):*

  * Stella: detail oriented, independent, works well alone.

  * Jack: asks a lot of questions, very flexible.

  * Our Pairin results are almost identical! Except that for emotional intelligence compentencies Jack has "I Get You" whereas Stella has "Self-Examiner."

  * Since we both have the Intuitive-Conceptual thinking style we can use logical thinking and our empathetic natures to work through problems whether they are interpersonal or logistical.

  * We both want to divide the work and do our work separately before coming back together, rather than navigator-driver style.

*How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:*

  * Again, we can fall back on sharing intuitive-conceptual in our Pairin as well as both being empathetic, to solve problems kindly and logically

  * We don't foresee that there will be any conflict.

  * Focusing independently really works well for both of us

#### Schedule Expectations

*(When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):*

  * Divide the work and then have a standing slack call daily at 5:00 PM so we can make sure that we are on the same page.

  * Jack is unavailable on Sunday AM (but flexible)

  * Stella is unavailable:
        Sunday 9 - 11AM
          & 7 - 8PM
        Monday 7 - 8PM
        Thursday 6 - 8PM
        Saturday 11AM - 4PM

#### Communication Expectations

*How and often will we communicate?*

  * Once a day and as needed. We are both on slack all the time.

*How do we keep lines of communication open?*

  * Daily check-ins

*How will we make decisions as a team?*

  * We will make all our decisions together and only move forward once we've agreed on something.

  * If we disagree, we will stop and discuss. We agree not to be sensitive if the other person doesn't agree with us, and we will work it out logically and calmly

  * They both agree to listen thoughtfully to each other's suggestions.

*How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?:*

  * Jack is really private and doesn't really need these check-ins, but we agree to communicate if anything really serious related to COVID-19 happens.

#### Abilities & Growth Expectations

*(Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):*

  * Jack definitely wants to get more comfortable with Github for pairs and understand branching and workflow.He also wants to hammer out testing.

  * Stella wants to get a better understanding of how and when to use Pry.

  * We agree to come to each other to work together to get better at these things.

#### Workload Expectations

*(What features do we each want to work on?):*

  We need to revisit this one later. We don't currently have enough information to complete this, but we will fill this in more thoroughly once we read the project requirements. Will be completed tomorrow __during Project Worktime__ 11AM-12PM Tuesday.

#### Workflow Expectations

*(Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):*

  * We will put comments in our personal pull requests before the other person looks over it.

  * Jack will try to make his comments really detailed.

  * Stella will make comments that anticipate questions he could have.

#### Pomodoro Break Schedule:
  * We will each decide on our own.

#### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

  * Jack is ok with being very frank and direct, and says there is no need to feel bad about disagreeing.

  * Stella is working on assuming positive intent, especially with written comments. Jack knows this and will be sensitive to it, because he is a kind, empathetic person.

#### Additional Remote Considerations:
  * Jack was having Wifi problems, but they are resolved.

#### Project management tools we will use
(GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):

  * We will definitely be using Trello! Stella hasn't downloaded it yet but will get on the bandwagon ASAP

#### Day 1 Agenda:

  * Our first meeting we are going to create project on Trello and divide up the workload

#### Additional Notes:

  * We agree that if something isn't working we will revisit this and revise.

  * We'll read over all the assignment criteria Monday night.

  * Stella will share the DTR markdown document tonight with Jack so he can sign off on it.
